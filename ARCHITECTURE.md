# HASAD - Architecture Documentation

## Overview
HASAD follows a **Clean Architecture** approach combined with a **Feature-First** structure to ensure scalability, maintainability, and offline-first capabilities.

## Mobile (Flutter)
- **Presentation Layer**: Riverpod for state management, GoRouter for navigation.
- **Domain Layer**: Entities and Repository interfaces.
- **Data Layer**: Repository implementations, Data sources (Dio for API, Drift for SQLite).
- **Core**: Cross-cutting concerns like synchronization, secure storage, and networking.

## Backend (.NET 8)
- **Web API**: Controllers and Middleware.
- **Application**: CQRS patterns using MediatR, FluentValidation.
- **Domain**: Core entities and business rules.
- **Infrastructure**: Persistence (EF Core, PostgreSQL), Identity, and External Services.

## Offline First Strategy
- **Local First**: Data is saved to SQLite via Drift first.
- **Sync Queue**: Operations are queued and processed when connectivity is detected.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins or Manual intervention based on entity type.

## Folder Structure (Mobile)
- `lib/core`: Cross-cutting logic (Networking, Storage, Config).
- `lib/features`: Domain-driven feature modules.
  - `auth`: Authentication logic.
  - `dashboard`: Main user interface and statistics.
  - `farmers`: Farmer management.
  - `farms`: Farm management.
  - `damage_reports`: Report creation and viewing.
  - `map`: GIS features.
- `lib/shared`: Reusable UI components and models.
